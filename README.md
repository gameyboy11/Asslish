# Asslish
A language created by me and my friends. While the README file will be mainly focused on, when the language is finished, I will release a dictionary script.

# Grammar

The grammer of Asslish is largely the same as English, with a few notable differences.

In a word like ‘Burger’, it would not have ‘er’ on the end, instead having ‘el’. The word burger in Asslish is Bügel.

In a word like ‘Running’, it would not have ‘ing’ on the end, instead having ‘ein’. The word running in Asslish is Bügel.

In a word like ‘Them’, it would not have ‘em’ on the end, instead having ‘ad’. The word them in Asslish is Fad.

In a word like ‘They’, it would not have ‘ey’ on the end, instead having ‘al’. The word They is Asslish is Fad.

We also try to keep pronunciation and spelling simple. For example, there is no ‘ch’ sound. Ch would be pronounced cu-huh. The only thing that is different is added is ‘ü’, which is pronounced oo

Most of the language is pronounced how it is spelt.

Genders are not considered. There is no ‘he’ or ‘she’. This is not for gender neutrality, this is for simplicity.
